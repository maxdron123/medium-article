      <h2>Optimize your tasks</h2>
      <p>
        For example, you want to spend your time for studying at home, but these small house duties take a lot of time to be done. Try to complete them together to save your precious time! For example, you can sweep and wash your floor while your food is cooking! Just check it from time to timeðŸ‘Œ
      </p>
      <h2>Put some music on, don't be boring!</h2>
      <p>
        Some neutral style music on the background will help to gather your thoughts together and reduce your stress. I would recommend Lo-Fi, Lounge and Loft styles.

      <h2>Breaks are important!</h2>
      <p>As long as you progress with your task, your brain is getting tired. You get easily distracted and save less information insede your head. Don't push yourself too hard, take a short 20 min break! Drink a cup of tea or coffie, check some memes your friend send you - anything is a good option!</p>
